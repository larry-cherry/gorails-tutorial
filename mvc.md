# The Model View Controller Pattern

## Models

Get /about HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0,0.1

User 
* query for records
* wrap individual records

## Routes
Masters for the url that is requested

Get for "about

I see you requested "/about", we'll give that to the AboutController to handle
## Views
* HTML
* CSV
* PDF
* XML

This is what gets sent back to the browser to display

## Controllers 
Decide how to process a request and define a response
